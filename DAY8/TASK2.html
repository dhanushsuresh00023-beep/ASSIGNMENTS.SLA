    <p class="info">CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>

<h2 id="style2">We can divide CSS selectors into five </h2>

 <ul> 
    <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
<li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
<li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
<li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
<li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>

</ul>
