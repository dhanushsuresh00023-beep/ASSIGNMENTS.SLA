    <p> <em>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum in Agra, India, commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Built between 1631 and 1648, this architectural masterpiece is renowned for its graceful symmetry, intricate inlay work, and status as a universal symbol of love and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</em> </p>
    <hr>
    <p> <em>Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2015 would be approximately ₹52.8 billion (US$827 million).</em></p>
<hr>
<p> <em>The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court. </em> </p>
